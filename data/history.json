    "article_full": "India's aviation watchdog has launched an investigation after an Air India plane's engine sucked in a cargo container while taxiing at the Delhi airport. No-one was hurt, but the aircraft's engine was damaged and it has been grounded for repairs. The New York-bound Airbus A350 had returned to Delhi shortly after take-off on Thursday after Iran temporarily closed its airspace, forcing airlines to reroute flights. After landing safely, the aircraft had left the runway and was taxiing to the parking bay with passengers on board when the cargo container was sucked into its right engine. Visibility was \"marginal\" due to dense fog at the time, the aviation regulator said. There were around 240 passengers in the aircraft when the container was sucked in, a source from Air India told the BBC. The exact number of crew members could not be ascertained but the source added it could be between six and eight people. According to India's ministry of civil aviation, the incident occurred on Thursday around 05:25 local time (23:55 GMT on Wednesday) as the aircraft was taxiing towards the apron area, where aircraft are parked, loaded, unloaded and refuelled. The cargo container had accidentally fallen from a ground vehicle \"onto the taxiway intersection\", it added. An Air India spokesperson added that the container fell after a wheel came off a cart that was being towed by a vehicle used to move luggage and cargo around the airport. The vehicle operator noticed the aircraft taxiing in and left the area with the remaining cargo. \"However, the container which fell was left behind and it got ingested into the No. 2 engine of the aircraft,\" Air India added. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said metal debris was later cleared from the taxiway, and the aircraft was towed and parked at a designated stand. It added that it has launched a detailed investigation into the incident. Photosshared by DGCA on Xshow damage to the aircraft's engine casing and fan blades, as well as debris lying on the taxiway. The incident adds to scrutiny around ground safety at India's busy airports. In June last year, the DGCAflagged significant safety lapsesat major Indian airports and airlines, finding issues such as faded runway markings, faulty simulator training, crew fatigue, inadequate maintenance and unauthorised cockpit access. Air India has also warned of \"potential disruptions on select A350 routes\" as the aircraft is grounded. Air India operatessix Airbus A350 aircrafton long-haul routes, including services to London and New York, Reuters reported. The airline hasn't specified which routes might be affected.

Support the journalism that documents what\u2019s happening \u2014 and why it matters. PresidentDonald Trumpappears to still be upset that the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize went to someone other than him, now suggesting that the snub was somehow linked to his push to acquire Greenland, the Danish semi-autonomous territory. In an extraordinary letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, first reported byPBS NewsHour, Trump said he no longer feels constrained by \u201can obligation\u201d to consider peace, adding that he is primarily focused on advancing U.S. interests. \u201cConsidering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,\u201d Trump wrote in a letter to St\u00f8re,according to Bloombergand PBS NewsHour. \u201cAlthough it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.\u201d The Nobel committee\u2019s five membersare appointed by Norway\u2019s parliament, and the country\u2019s government is not involved in the selection of the laureates. In astatement, St\u00f8re said Trump\u2019s message came shortly after he and Finnish President Alexander Stubb reached out to the U.S. president to express their opposition toTrump\u2019s threatto impose new tariffs on Finland, Norway and other countries starting Feb. 1 over their objection to his goal to acquire Greenland. \u201cGreenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter,\u201d St\u00f8re said. \u201cWe also support that NATO in a responsible way is taking steps to strengthen security and stability in the Arctic.\u201d St\u00f8re added that he has repeatedly made clear to Trump that the Norwegian government has no input on the selection of the Nobel Peace Prize winner. This year\u2019s Nobel laureate Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado presented Trump with her award during her recent visit to the White House,later saying that the U.S. president \u201cdeserves\u201d the honor. While Trump\u2019s relentless push for U.S. control of Greenland has encountered stiff opposition both at home and abroad, the president questioned why Denmark, a NATO ally, has control of the arctic island. \u201cDenmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a \u2018right of ownership\u2019 anyway?\u201d Trump asked in his letter to St\u00f8re. \u201cThere are no written documents, it\u2019s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also,\u201d he added. \u201cI have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.\u201d Greenlandwas incorporated into Denmark in 1953, but remains self-governed and has its own parliament.

    "article_full": "Donald Trump has vowed to \"100%\" follow through on his threat to impose tariffs on European countries who oppose his demand to take control of Greenland. European allies have rallied around Greenland's sovereignty. Denmark's foreign minister emphasised the US president cannot threaten his way to ownership of the semi-autonomous Danish territory. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reiterated the UK's position that the future of Greenland is for \"Greenlanders and for the Danes alone\" to decide. On Monday, Trump declined to rule out the use of force and insisted he would press ahead with the threatened tariffs on goods arriving in the US from the UK and seven other Nato-allied countries. Asked by NBC News if he would use force to seize Greenland, Trump answered: \"No comment\". The US president said he would charge Britain a 10% tariff \"on any and all goods\" sent to the US from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June, until a deal is reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark. Trump said the same would apply to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland - all of whom are members of the defence alliance Nato which was founded in 1949. Asked if he will follow through on the tariff threat, Mr Trump told NBC News: \"I will, 100%.\" Trump added: \"Europe ought to focus on the war with Russia and Ukraine because, frankly, you see what that's gotten them... That's what Europe should focus on - not Greenland.\" Denmark has warned that US military action in Greenland would spell the end of Nato. In recent days, Greenland has received support from European members of the alliance - some even sent a handful of troops to Greenland last week in a move seen as symbolic. However, Trump followed that deployment with an announcement to impose tariffs on the eight Nato allies. Danish foreign minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen said that Europe had to show President Trump tariff threats were \"not the way forward\". \"We have red lines that can't be crossed,\" he told Sky News. \"You can't threaten your way to ownership of Greenland. I have no intention of escalating this situation.\" Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said the alliance will keep working with Denmark and Greenland on the security of the Arctic. The European Union is to hold an emergency summit in Brussels for its leaders on Thursday where they will discuss how to respond to Trump's latest threat to take over Greenland. Kaja Kallas, the EU's foreign policy chief, said the bloc has \"no interest to pick a fight, but we will hold our ground\". \"But trades threats are not the way to go about this,\" Kallas added. \"Sovereignty is not for trade.\" It comes as text exchanges between Trump and the Norwegian prime minister were released - showing that on Sunday theUS president blamed Norway for the fact he didn't get the Nobel Peace Prize. In his reply - seen by the BBC - Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re explained that an independent committee, not the government of Norway, awards the prize which last October went to Venezuela's opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado. \"Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter,\" St\u00f8re added. Trump also addressed the text message exchange in Monday's interview and said: \"Norway totally controls it [the Nobel Prize] despite what they say. \"They like to say they have nothing to do with it, but they have everything to do with it.\" Meanwhile, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) on Monday announced that multiple aircraft are on their way to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland. The joint US-Canada military defence organisation stressed they are part of a routine operation \"to support various long-planned Norad activities\", and said they had been coordinated with Denmark and that the government of Greenland had been informed. Similar Norad operations at the base took place in 2022, 2023, and last year. Executive orders, pardons, trips and Truth Social posts - the BBC\u2019s Analysis Editor breaks down Donald Trump\u2019s first year back in office, in numbers. Donald Trump's former chief economic adviser said the US president's actions are a negotiating tactic. We asked six Americans what they make of the US economy one year after President Trump returned to the White House. Attorney General Pam Bondi vows \"full force of federal law\" against protestors as tension over ICE remains high in the state. The US president insists Norway controls who gets the coveted prize, while the Norwegian government says it has nothing to do with the decision. Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved.
